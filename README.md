# Y2_2022_05868_Platformer
## Introduction

This is the project for the course programming course Y2 CS-A1121 
Basic platforming game where you have to avoid traps and collect coins as fast as possible
## File and directory structure

  There are to directiories for code and for project documents.
  Code directory has a folder for content which are the images used for graphics in the game
  and a folder for called map that has the classes that construct the levels. 

## Installation instructions

  If you have PYQT5 there shouldn't be any problems running the program

## User instructions

  Executed through normal python compling
  A to move character left, D to move right, SPACE to jump, ESC to access pausemenu. 
















# Checkpoint1

## Current properties

What properties have you already implemented into your project? What can be done with the program at this point?

Currently I have a game loop setup which keeps the game updating. A movable character which you can controll through WASD. The character is affected by gravity and currently has a very wonky jump function. A kind of level generates (currently only backgroud generates) but walkable platforms are in the game. A basic collision detection with platforms exists but need a bit of work still. 
## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? (yes/no)
 - How is the program executed?

 Yes the program can be run through basic python compiling.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far?
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?

About 15h give or take, thought I could put more hours into it in the recent weeks, but other courses came first and I have been sick also. 
No changes to the project plan, I am almost on schedule, I just need to get the things I have implemented working correctly. This shouldn't be a technical challenge anymore, I have figured out how to get them to work, I just need to put in some time to code the fixes. 

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems?
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?

 I have had a bit of a hard time figuring PyQt5 to do the things I want. I think reading PyQt5 documentation has taken the most time so far in this project. 
 One thing I have added to my plan is to add some sort of spike traps or something to balance the game. I have plans to make it a platformer where you climb out of a tower/dungeon so you can't really fall down pitfalls only to the ground level. Traps should balance this out so there is a risk of dying when climbing. 

# Checkpoint 2

## Current properties

What properties have you already implemented into your project? What can be done with the program at this point?

There is a somewhat working game currently with player character, basic death, I added pause menu but the buttons don't do anything yet, you can climb on the platform and die from spikes
## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? (yes/no)
 - How is the program executed?
Yes the program can be run through basic python compiling.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far?
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?

 I have put maybe 30 hours on the project, I have some problems with getting collision working correctly. I have downscaled a project a lot from the original plan, I will get to normal requirments working and some hard ones like score system but other than that just a basic game. I last few weeks I have been really sick so I am behind schedule but I will have to work hard this coming week to catch up. I dropped enemies last checkpoint but I will work on adding some obstacles that move for more dynamic gameplay. 

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems?
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?

 As I said earlier I have had to downscale the project a lot because of health issues, but I am good now and will work hard to get a finished project out in time. I have had problems with the collision detection and writing test cases so they are a bit lacking this checkpoint but for the finished version I will try to have more of them.
