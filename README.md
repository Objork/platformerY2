## Current properties

What properties have you already implemented into your project? What can be done with the program at this point?

Currently I have a game loop setup which keeps the game updating. A movable character which you can controll through WASD. The character is affected by gravity and currently has a very wonky jump function. A kind of level generates (currently only backgroud generates) but walkable platforms are in the game. A basic collision detection with platforms exists but need a bit of work still. 
## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? (yes/no)
 - How is the program executed?

 Yes the program can be run through basic python compiling.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far?
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?

About 15h give or take, thought I could put more hours into it in the recent weeks, but other courses came first and I have been sick also. 
No changes to the project plan, I am almost on schedule, I just need to get the things I have implemented working correctly. This shouldn't be a technical challenge anymore, I have figured out how to get them to work, I just need to put in some time to code the fixes. 

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems?
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?

 I have had a bit of a hard time figuring PyQt5 to do the things I want. I think reading PyQt5 documentation has taken the most time so far in this project. 
 One thing I have added to my plan is to add some sort of spike traps or something to balance the game. I have plans to make it a platformer where you climb out of a tower/dungeon so you can't really fall down pitfalls only to the ground level. Traps should balance this out so there is a risk of dying when climbing.
